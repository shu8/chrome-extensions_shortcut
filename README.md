chrome://extensions keyboard shortcut
==========================

Press Ctrl+Shift+E (Cmd+Shift+E on OSX) to open the chrome://extensions page (for Chrome Extension Developers, for ease :)

---

I don't know about you, but I satrted developing Chrome Extensions a few weeks ago, and opening http://chrome-extensions every time is a pain. I don't want to keep it open, because I have too many tabs open already.

So, to help me learn about chrome.commands, I created this extension!  

Feel free to edit!
