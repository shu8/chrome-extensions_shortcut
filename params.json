Type your preferred shortcut.\r\n\r\n### Why would I need this?\r\nI don't know about you, but I started developing Chrome Extensions a few weeks ago, and opening http://chrome-extensions every time is already a pain. I don't want to keep that tab open, because I have too many tabs open already.\r\n\r\nI'm new to Chrome Development so, to help me learn about `chrome.commands`, I created this extension!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
